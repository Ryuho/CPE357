Assignment: Project 1 - myunexpand

This project compiles and correctly works exactly like unexpand 
(with a few difference) on vogon, falcon and sparc. Every function
is documented for clarity.

The list of difference between the two are:
 - myunexpand does not have a --version option
 - myunexpand does not have a --tabs=LIST option
 - myunexpand does not expand a single space no matter what, 
      unlike unexpand which converts a space into tab if
      the character after the single space is a white space.
      
The last difference was due to the way I wrote my program.
Since I wrote it to parse through characters one at a time,
it is very hard for my program to know what kind of
character is ahead of the current stream.

If you take a look at the diff of unexpand and myunexpand 
output of sample1.txt you will see that 10c10 is different,
and that's an example of the limitation on my code.
