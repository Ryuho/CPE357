Project 7

I couldnt' get the pipes to work correctly, but it handles all the signal stuff,
file input as command, input and output redirection with one process.

The project has been documented and a html documentation has been
uploaded to <http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~rkudo/CSC357/proj7/index.html>
generated by doxygen
