This project compiles and correctly works as specified on

<filename>. It also does not have any errors on valgrind and
it does not leak memory even with very long file (1MB of text).

To compile the project, cd into the directory with Makefile and
source code and type "make" on the terminal with out any arguments.

being an error.
