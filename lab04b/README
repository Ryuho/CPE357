Please run the make4mb program to make a 4MB file before running these tests. 
I was tempted to put it in the bashscript.sh that I wrote to run the tests, 
but I figured this would be annoying since it creates a 4MB file automatically.

After you run make4mb, run the bash script bashscript.sh to run the copy tests.


Here is the table for runtime of 4MB of file copy with various buffer size.

OS	Buffer  |real		   user		sys
---------------------------------------------
Linux	1    |0m29.679s	0m1.998s	0m10.241s
Linux	512  |0m4.757s	   0m0.003s	0m0.028s
Linux	1000 |0m1.483s	   0m0.003s	0m0.026s
Linux	8192 |0m2.783s	   0m0.001s	0m0.013s
---------------------------------------------
SunOS	1    |0m50.938s   0m9.713s 0m41.210s
SunOS	512  |0m0.159s    0m0.012s	0m0.112s
SunOS	1000 |0m0.143s		0m0.012s	0m0.091s
SunOS	8192 |0m0.134s		0m0.003s	0m0.047s

I don't think things have changed much since 04' when the author ran the code.
