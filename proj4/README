Assignment: Project 4 - Huffman

This project compiles on all required computers.

To compile the project, cd into the directory with Makefile and
source code and type "make" on the terminal with out any arguments.

There are many extra print outs because I was dubugging it till the last minute.

The practice file works, (the one on the website with 5 letters)

I believe the tree structure is built correctly.

I had to use magic numbers for the bit operation function, but I tried avoding using
them otherwise.


I believe the encoder works although it crashes on longer files I think because 
the bit length becomes larger than the default size.

when run under valgrind, it gives out one error I could not track down. This program
leaks a lot.

The decoder does not work, although it does read the headers, but I could not implement
the reading of the binary part. 



The project has been documented and a html documentation has been
uploaded to <http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~rkudo/CSC357/proj4/index.html>
