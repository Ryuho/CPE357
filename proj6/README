Ryuho Kudo
CPE357 Project 6a
Parseline

I got everything working except for valgrind memory leaks
and a few of the error messages are different, but everything
else should be in pretty good shape.

I included the .sh bash script i used to test mine, I wish I could 
emulate the keystorkes as i had to copy paste for each test.

The project has been documented and a html documentation has been
uploaded to <http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~rkudo/CSC357/proj6/index.html>
